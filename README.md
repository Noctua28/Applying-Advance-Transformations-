# Applying Advance Transformations 
 
For this project we worked with a heavily modified version of the Superheroes dataset from Kaggle. 

The dataset includes two csv's:

- superhero_info.csv:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS1ZstYLwFgwhZnqDsPjtnlHYhJp_cmW55J8JD5mym0seRsaem3px7QBtuFF0LiI7z1PLCkVKAkdO7J/pub?output=csv

Contains Name, Publisher, Demographic Info, and Body measurements.

- superhero_powers.csv:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSzdWOBaXOoz52vPmCFV5idNlDBohLY1Lsbc1IfZIZQ7cV_aNB2wYBfhF49uE1TaO1B5MQCGWiNrFfd/pub?output=csv

Contains Hero name and list of powers

# Work Performed

1. Both datasets were cleaned and combined into one final DataFrame. 

2. Using the combined DataFrame the following questions were answered:

A) Compare the average weight of super powers who have Super Speed to those who do not. 

B) What is the average height of heroes for each publisher?
